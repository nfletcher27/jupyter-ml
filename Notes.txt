Steps for a machine learning project:

1. Import our data
2. Clean our data
3. Split our data into training and testing sets
4. Create our model using an algorithm
5. Train our model
6. Make predictions
7. Evaluate and improve our model

Utilize Numpy, Pandas, MatPlotLib, and Scikit-Learn
Utilize Anaconda with Jupyter Notebook for visualization

Download Anaconda
Through Anaconda Navigator open Jupyter Notebook
Create new folder to host project
Create Python notebook in folder
Select .csv file of choice and move into folder with Python notebook
...
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('vgsales.csv')
df

df.shape will return (16598, 11) which is technically a 2d array
df.describe() returns data of our .csv
- count
- mean
- std
- min
- 25%, 50%, 75%, max

What is a .ipynb file?
- It is an organized file of .py files which holds each individual cell and it's output, so we do not have to run
all files at once when working with large data sets
